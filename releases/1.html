					Recorded on shitty 70s consumer tape decks, Fair Enough is a lo-fi experience
					you can play at your stoner parties.<br>
					In an age where the dance floor is no longer the place to hook up, Fair Enough will
					calm your emotions, it will lower your libido, it will keep you out of trouble.
					This is a mixtape that features different music improvised and played by a trio
					already known as "The Blue Men".<br>
					Nicolò Masetto on keys, Simone Coppiello on drums and A.M. Davì on bass.
					Working with the trio was a blast! Thank you guys!! They never complained about
					shitty cassette decks and crappy sound.<br>
					I call it Opium Funk or Hashish Disco.<br>
					<br>
					Enjoy the listening!<br>
					<br>
					Carboidrati Nightmare<br>
					<br>
					P.S.<br>
					however this is an full analog work that has never seen the computer, the audio
					files you find here are ripped directly from the cassette, I guarantee that listening to
					this shit on tape is better.<br>
					The "cassette rip" download divides the work into four parts, which pisses me off
					because the cassette only has side A and side B but unfortunately the files I can
					upload cannot be larger than 291MB right now...so...fair enough.<br>
					see you around<br>
					C.N.
