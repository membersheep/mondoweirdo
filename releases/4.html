					Recording this duo was uplifting!<br>
					Enrico and Andrea spoke little and played a lot in those sessions so it wasn't difficult for me to catch the vibe…I used my crappy tape recorders and I got lost during their long improvisations. Crazy sound!<br>
					The final psychedelic ingredient was missing and so I layered the duo sessions with the windy sound of ney played by Virginia and the keys played by David.<br>
					A friend of mine says it somehow reminds him of Angus Maclise's music, I don't know.<br>
					I loved selecting the recorded material in the morning before having breakfast, the aim was to produce a lysergic cassette to listen to in the morning as soon as I woke up.<br>
					I never understood why they wanted to call it "Mitologia Euganea", maybe it has something to do with these places where we recorded.<br>
					Enjoy!<br>
