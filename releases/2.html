					Damn Brain seeks the absurd. But who is it and where is it located? Damn Brain is
					a melting unit which travels to the golden seasides of electroacoustic experimental
					music of the 1950s to acid-trip inspired oscillator sounds possibly heard while
					looking at a György Ligeti’s portrait puzzle with missing pieces, dissolving on the
					ground during a storm in downtown Berlin in 1996. Damn Brain is the echo of a
					thought, a consciousness teetering between the rational and the surreal. It has no
					defined body nor fixed identity, but it manifests in three entities, each a reflection
					of the others. It resides in a timeless place, a limbo where reality bends and the
					laws of physics dissolve. Here, among the waves of impossible geometries, Damn
					Brain roams, dancing to insistent notes and seeking meaning in the absurd, while
					impatient snails.<br>
